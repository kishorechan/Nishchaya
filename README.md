A Kannada font i am working on. 

Disclaimer:

A work in progress (WIP) font is released here.  There are problems in the font rendering - ವೊ  ವೋ  ಮೊ  ಮೋ ಳೊ ಳೋ and more than one ottus.  I am working to fix this. ಅರ್ಕಾವತ್ತು is omitted by design.  Exercise caution while using the WIP font file.  I am not responsible for any damages occuring in any way arising out of using this font.

I intend to create variants of this font 
- Chukki - Dot Matrix font
- Daara - Thread/Stitch like font

**Special Thanks:**

I view these videos to create this font.
